# NYC High School SAT Scores 

For this project, I explored the relationship between students' SAT scores in New York City and various demographics.

I combined the following data sets into a clean, pandas dataframe:
* [NYC SAT Scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)
* [School Attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt)
* [Class Size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)
* [AP Test Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e)
* [Graduation Outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a)
* [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j)
* [School Survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)
